# Pros & Cons of Docusaurus

## Pros:

- **Easy to Set Up & Use** – Minimal configuration with a simple folder structure (docs, blog, src).
- **Markdown & MDX Support** – Write in Markdown, with MDX allowing embedded React components.
- **Built-in Features for Documentation** – Includes search, versioning, and internationalization (i18n).
- **Highly Customizable** – Built with React, supports custom themes, layouts, and styles.
- **Fast & SEO-Friendly** – Generates static HTML, ensuring fast loading and built-in SEO optimization.
- **Pluggable Architecture** – Supports official and third-party plugins (RSS, Google Analytics, Sitemap, PWA).
- **Easy Deployment** – Deploy easily to GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Azure, etc.
- **Strong Community & Maintained by Meta** – Actively maintained with regular updates and community support.

## Cons:

- Does not have a **built-in content editor**.
- Does not have a traditional **admin panel** for managing content visually.
- Best for documentation, but not ideal for **full-fledged blogs or e-commerce**.
- Simple setup is easy, but deep customization (e.g., modifying themes, adding complex plugins) requires React and Webpack knowledge.
- Best for static content, lacks built-in support for databases or real-time data.
- Docusaurus includes React, which **increases bundle size** compared to ultra-light static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll.
